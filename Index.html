				<h2>Telltale Games' Revival Thanks to Venture Capital Funding</h2>
				<p>By Adam Oubaita | April 24, 2023</p>
			</header>
			<p>The gaming industry has been experiencing exponential growth over the past few years, with an increasing number of venture capital investors pouring funds into the industry. This trend is not surprising, as the gaming industry has grown to become a lucrative sector, with global revenues projected to reach $217.9 billion by 2023.</p>
			<p>One example of a gaming company that has benefited from venture capital funding is Telltale Games. After experiencing financial difficulties and declaring bankruptcy in 2018, the company was purchased by LGC Entertainment in 2019 and has been conducting business under the Telltale label.</p>
			<p>Telltale Games rose to fame with their narrative-driven, episodic games, with titles such as The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, and Jurassic Park. The company's success was cut short when they were forced to close down, and their future seemed uncertain. However, in a recent series A funding round, Telltale Games raised $8 million, with Hiro Capital and Skybound
                bound Entertainment leading the funding round.</p>
                <p>The new funding will help finance the development of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, which is set to release this summer, as well as the development of The Wolf Among Us 2. The news of Telltale Games' revival has been welcomed by fans of the company's prior games, as no games have been released in the four years since the company was officially revived.</p>
                <p>Telltale Games' story is a prime example of how venture capital investors can help bring back to life struggling gaming companies. With adequate funding, companies can continue developing games and release them to the public, ultimately generating revenue and creating jobs.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, venture capital investors can also help address toxic work issues within gaming companies. This was the case with Telltale Games, as one of the reasons for their initial closure was due to toxic work issues. With the new funding, the company's CEO, Jamie Ottilie, has stated that they are looking to learn from their past and focus on creating a positive work environment.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the gaming industry continues to grow, and venture capital investors are playing an instrumental role in propping up struggling companies. The revival of Telltale Games is a prime example of this, and with adequate funding and a focus on creating a positive work environment, the company is set to release new games and continue entertaining gamers worldwide.</p>
